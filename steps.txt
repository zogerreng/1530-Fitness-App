1. Creating a virtual environment (only needs done once)
    python -m venv venv

2. Activating the virtual environment (needs done each time you work on the code)
    * In Mac OS:      source venv/bin/activate
    * In Windows:     .\venv\Scripts\activate 

    check if your terminal command prompt has the virtual 
        environment name '(venv)' 
    
    * for Windows users, if you get an error message, it probably
        means that you don't have permission to execute this command
        as a regular user. Please type this instead:

        run VS code IDE as admin and and put this in terminal: 

            set-executionpolicy remotesigned

3. Install once virtual environment is active

    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run

    python login_page.py

    OR 
    
    python3 login_page.py

5. Copy and paste the link they give into a browser

    ex. http://127.0.0.1:5000

6. If you install any other dependencies:

    pip freeze > requirements.txt
